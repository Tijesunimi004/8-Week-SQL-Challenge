<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<font size = "+1">Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a <br> risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.</font>

<h2><b>Problem Statement</h2></b>
<font size = "+1">Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, <br>especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which <br>menu items are their favourite.Having this deeper connection with his customers will help <br>him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.</font>

<font size = "+1"><br>He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the<br>
existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic<br>
datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.<br>
Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues<br>
but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries <br>
to help him answer his questions!</font>

<font size = "+1">Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:<br>
<ol>
<li>sales</li>
<li>menu</li>
<li>members</li></ol>
You can inspect the entity relationship diagram and example data below.</font>

<br><h2>Case Study Questions<h2>
<font size = "+1.5">Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:</font>
<font size = "+0.2"><ol>
<li>What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</li>
<li>How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</li>
<li>What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</li>
<li>What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</li>
<li>Which item was the most popular for each customer?</li>
<li>Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</li>
<li>Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?</li>
<li>What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?</li>
<li>If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?</li>
<li>In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - <br>how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?</li>
