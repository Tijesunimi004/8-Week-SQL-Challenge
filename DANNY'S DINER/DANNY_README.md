<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<font size = "+1">Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a <br> risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.</font>

<h2><b>Problem Statement</h2></b>
<font size = "+1">Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, <br>especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which <br>menu items are their favourite.Having this deeper connection with his customers will help <br>him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.</font>

<font size = "+1"><br>He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the<br>
existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic<br>
datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.<br>
Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues<br>
but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries <br>
to help him answer his questions!</font>

<font size = "+1">Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:<br>
<ol>
<li>sales</li>
<li>menu</li>
<li>members</li></ol>
You can inspect the entity relationship diagram and example data below.</font>
